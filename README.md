README Journal-Lux Bodycare
Team Name: Suds Sisters
Natalie Brigman and Ashley Evans
2/20: We decided to do a body care business.
2/21: Work on Wireframing

Lux Bodycare is an all natural business that makes homemade soaps, scrubs, bath bombs, and lip balms. All products are made with natural ingredients. 

2/25: We finished our wireframing for all pages.

Lee Anne Brigman always wondered how everyday products were made. We all use soap every single day. She wanted to learn how to make it herself so every time she needed some, she didn’t have to go to the store. Lee Anne learned and perfected the craft of soap making. After that, she found it so fun that she wanted to learn how to make other products. Now, she knows how to make many things. When her friends and family found out she made homemade body care products, they all wanted to buy some. Lee Anne turned a hobby into something she can make a profit from.

We want to show people the outcome of wanting to do things yourself. The natural ingredients we use are a nice change to the tons of chemicals used in commercial businesses.

The website consists of 6 pages: Home, About, Products, New, Best Sellers, and Contact.

Home: Our home page will show pictures of various homemade soaps.

About: This page will contain our story and how the business started.

Products: This page is where we will add pictures, descriptions, and the ingredients in our soaps as well as our other products.

New: We will have some new and fresh products on this page.

Best Sellers: This page will show the classic products that Lux Bodycare offers.

Contact: This page will have the email and phone number of the founder as well as her photo.

2/26: Today, we hope to start our home page. We want to due the basics like background colors, adding text, and different fonts. Also, we want to add a nav bar to the home page.


We had trouble trying to link our html to our css. After many trials and errors, we figured it out. We added our nav bar as well. 

2/27: Today, we will make our nav bar horizontal instead of in a column. We will also try to add different fonts.

3/1: We will try to add more pages to our website. We want to add the about, products, new, best sellers, and cart pages.

After many minutes of frustration, we finally figured out how to link all of our html pages. We put an unneeded hashtag in it. Today, we linked all of our individual pages to the home page. It took us a very long time, but we fixed the issue.

3/4: Start on our other pages. Design the basic structure and color of it.

We added the nav bar to all of our pages and found our theme images. It took 15 forevers to find images that had a transparent background.

We had trouble attaching the names of the products to the pictures of the products. We added some pictures and labels to the product page.
